  # cache-max-ttl: <seconds>
  #     Time  to  live maximum for RRsets and messages in the cache. De-
  #     fault is 86400 seconds (1 day).  When the TTL expires, the cache
  #     item  has  expired.   Can  be set lower to force the resolver to
  #     query for data often, and not trust  (very  large)  TTL  values.
  #     Downstream clients also see the lower TTL.
  cache-max-ttl: 86400

  # cache-min-ttl: <seconds>
  #     Time  to  live minimum for RRsets and messages in the cache. De-
  #     fault is 0.  If the minimum kicks in, the  data  is  cached  for
  #     longer than the domain owner intended, and thus less queries are
  #     made to look up the data.  Zero makes sure the data in the cache
  #     is  as the domain owner intended, higher values, especially more
  #     than an hour or so, can lead to trouble as the data in the cache
  #     does not match up with the actual data any more.
